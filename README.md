My engineering stuff!


## Dice Roller
For a while I foolishly kept trying to find libraries that read key presses because I thought I wanted it to work like an interrupt. It took too long, but I figured out the the user would be the one controlling each roll and wouldn't need it as fast as possible. Also I tried using "None" instead of checking if the length was zero, but I think input() doesn't result null values.


## Calculator
This one wasn't too bad for, but I forgot to cast the input as an integer for a bit. It was an easy fix. Other than that I didn't really encounter any problems besides typos. 

## Quadratic Solver
This one was fun. The main hiccup I had was forgetting to cast the input as integers. Every other problem was pretty much a typo. I did forget to make it a function and had to retroactively turn it into one, but that didn't take long. Just a simple, straight forward assignment.
## String Splitter
This one was fine, but there were a few lines where I made a thoughtless mistake. Nothing that couldn't be fixed after one round of bug fixing. The more major problem was that my repo got corrupted. I reinitialized it, and it would successfully pull from Github, but it wouldn't push to it. I ended up deleting the whole thing and recloning it, which worked out.

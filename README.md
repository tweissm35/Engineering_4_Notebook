My engineering stuff!


## Dice Roller
For a while I foolishly kept trying to find libraries that read key presses because I thought I wanted it to work like an interrupt. It took too long, but I figured out the the user would be the one controlling each roll and wouldn't need it as fast as possible. Also I tried using "None" instead of checking if the length was zero, but I think input() doesn't result null values.


## Calculator
This one wasn't too bad for, but I forgot to cast the input as an integer for a bit. It was an easy fix. Other than that I didn't really encounter any problems besides typos.
